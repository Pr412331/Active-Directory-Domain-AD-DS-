# Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) Implementation & GPO Management
I recently engineered a comprehensive Active Directory infrastructure project that transitions manual sysadmin tasks into a fully automated workflow. Using PowerShell, I built a system that constructs an enterprise-level domain from scratch—creating OUs, security groups, and onboarding users from departmental data files with built-in conflict resolution logic. The project demonstrates a "Security-First" approach, featuring RBAC-driven file permissions and GPO-enforced workstation compliance, effectively simulating a real-world enterprise environment. This lab highlights my expertise in automation, identity management, and troubleshooting complex directory service conflicts.
